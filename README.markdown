#Foldergallery-jQuery
## Description
Foldergallery-jQuery is a module for LEPTON_2series. 
It's an imagegallery to handle many images in different categories using various jQuery plugins. 
Categories are based on the folderstructure on the server (media-directory = root directory), so they are created
automaticly if you sync the filesystem with the database in the foldergallery backend.
