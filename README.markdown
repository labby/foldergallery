#Foldergallery
## Description
Foldergallery-jQuery is a module for LEPTON CMS. 
It's an imagegallery to handle many images in different categories using various jQuery plugins. 
Categories are based on the folderstructure on the server (media-directory = root directory), so they are created
automaticly if you sync the filesystem with the database in the foldergallery backend.

## IMPORTANT
Jquery core and eventually jquery migrate have to be loaded via frontend template.
Both files are not loaded via this addon since version 2.2.0
