## Foldergallery
### Description
Foldergallery is a module for LEPTON CMS. 
It's an imagegallery to handle many images in different categories using various jQuery plugins. 
Categories are based on the folderstructure on the server (media-directory = root directory), so they are created
automaticly if you sync the filesystem with the database in the foldergallery backend.

### IMPORTANT
Jquery core and eventually jquery migrate are loaded via get_page_headers to your frontend template (starting with release 3.0).
